        strong Welcome to Civic Graph developers portal!
      p.span8.offset2 Civic Graph is an open source data and visualization project initiated by Microsoft's Technology & Civic Innovation team.
      p.span8.offset2 The purpose of Civic Graph is to provide insights into the burgeoning civic tech community -- who it consists of, what their respective focus areas are, and how they connect to one another.
      p.span8.offset2 Civic Graph takes a broad definition of civic tech and includes for-profit, non-profit, government agencies, and individuals.
      p.span8.offset2 We see Civic Graph as an educational tool, as a platform to crowdsource up-to-date information regarding the civic tech community, and as a basis to use the data to build out new visualizations, tools, and apps.
      p.span8.offset2 We invite you to contribute to Civic Graph by:
